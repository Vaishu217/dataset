1871,SeekingMoreInfo,Thanks for thinking of me but in my roll as Development Director at Yoo Energy Iwe already have 500MW pipeline in the UK on BESS and 150MW of solar whilst also covering wind and EFW. With further late-stage solar projects also in Italy and Spain. I have a strong carry and good base salary so quite sticky here.The position is 3-days a week. Allowing me to run my own work as a broker via my business Green Deck where I closed 24m of equity funding last year for clients. My network from Green Deck naturally compliments Yoo Energy feeding projects into our pipeline.But on the flip side and I hope relevant if you do come across renewable energy projects for sale or developers looking for funding partners please to reach out. An introduced project that closes earns a 13 share of the fee which is success only to the client. Where a typical fee is between 1-3 of a transaction.Best of luck with the placement.Anthony AgnewManaging DirectorMob: 44 778 606 3656aa@greendeck.co.ukmailto:aa@greendeck.co.ukwww.greendeck.co.uk

To do so you may reply to this message.Thank youbd@iptp.net------------------------------------------------------------------------------VladimirCongratulations Youxe2u20acu2122ve made it successfully through the pandemic havenxe2u20acu2122t lostyour sang froid on all those Zoom calls and have started growing your businessagain. Cloud migrations have soared over the last year to ensure businesscontinuity and accelerate transformations.Although the public cloud is a central pillar of everyonexe2u20acu2122s digitaltransformation strategy attempting to migrate all applications andinfrastructure to a single cloud provider risks cost overruns and outrightmigration failure.72 of companies who have migrated to the public cloud report that they haverepatriated at least onemajor application on-premise.What your customers need instead is to deploy applications into the bestlocation possible and integrate them across on-premises your private cloudand the public cloud. The market for such hybrid cloud services is growingrapidly and is expected to reach USD 145 billion.The big question is as a data center managed services and private cloudleader are you able to provide this hybrid cloud capabilityIt is extraordinarily difficult to integrate multiple clouds or public cloudswith on-premise and private cloud locations. This requires complexarchitectural components including service discovery monitoring DNSarchitecture network configuration and a variety of other integrations.European MSPs are effortlessly deploying hybrid cloud architectures andupgrading their private cloud capabilities with cutting-edge Kubernetes andcontainer deployments by using ProtoCloud.The platform takes a radically different approach to deploying applications andinfrastructure together whether on-premise into a private cloud the publiccloud or edge locations. It simplifies deployments with pre-integrated toolingand more.ProtoCloud helps companies accelerate migrating and modernizing applicationswithout imposing an all-or-nothing migration or a complete redevelopment. Allthis in a single well-architected platform.If this piques your interest can we ask for 10 minutes in your diary to helpyou offer these capabilities to your customersWarm

9773,ConnectLater, I refer to your contact with Noel Clifford in Darwin. We already have an number of established relationships with specialists recruiters both in our local state and territory and interstate. Thank you for your interest in recruiting for Nexia Edwards Marshall NT. Here is how we work with recruiters and if you wish to work with us you will need to align to this following:  1.  We will always advertise ourselves on Seek  2.  For a minimum period of at least 2 weeks following our advertising we will not accept any candidates from recruiters  3.  We do not accept candidates from recruiters unless they have sent through their Terms of Business and rates.  4.  We do not accept candidates from recruiters for graduate entry level roles or support staff roles - only experience professional staff  5.  We do not enter into exclusive relationships with recruiters but maintain positive relationships with a number of recruiters.   Therefore we will not sign an exclusive service agreement.  6.  We will not use recruiters that charge more than 17 on roles under 140000 pkg - the recruiter we work with the most charges us 12 but most others are around 15-17  7.  If you have a suitable candidate you need to send through a brief outline generally without a name so I can advise whether we are interested in seeing the candidate or not.  8.  We will not accept resumes sent through unsolicited when no role has been advertised or a brief outline sent for our review.  9.  Partners  Senior staff are not to be sent resumes directly as we receive candidates from a number of sources and often duplicates and endeavour to honour the first source. Please ensure that you update your records with myself as the primary contact and no further approaches are made to the partners.

Does it matter When a new missive from the mysterious internet poster known only as Q surfaced late last month it arrived in a very different world than the one that existed nearly two years ago when Qs last postappeared.The message which said xe2x80x9cAre you ready to serve your country againxe2x80x9d came as many Americans were following congressional hearings probing the events around the storming of the US Capitol on Jan. 6 2021. Some of the participants in that insurrection were adherents of the QAnon conspiracy a fringe movement that spreads the false belief that global liberal elites are members of a child sex abuse ring.The political movement which closely tracks messages from the anonymous Q account has given rise to a cottage industry that includes merchandise available on Amazon YouTube channels and tacit encouragement from a range of US politicians. Members have also promoted false claims that President Joe Biden won the 2020 election through fraud leading to the question of whether Qs return might result in even more internet disinformation.But Q isnt really the issue anymore said Joseph E. Uscinski an associate professor at the University of Miami whos studied QAnon for years. Reached by phone recentlyUscinski said thatQ is a symptom of a larger issue not the cause.With or without the Q account he said Americans should be worried about the prevalence of conspiracy theoriesin modern life.xe2x80x9cMost of the QAnon believers were not at Jan. 6xe2x80x9d Uscinski said. xe2x80x9cMost of the people who believe there was rampant voter fraud were not at Jan. 6 either.xe2x80x9d

Gaia will then hand over the project to our managers who will delegate it to our writers. Writers will deliver. 4. Editors will edit and QC. 5. Gaia will deliver to Wint. 6.

Given the quantum of work our proposed fee for this would be INR 1.5 per word excluding GST we already factor in that you need 500 blogs every month averaging over 1000 words each. We also have less experienced writers available within our team who we can offer at a substantial discount without affecting the quantum of work.

Subscribe to The Information here for 25 off your first year normally 399.GreetingsMore than a month ago our colleagues in Hong Kong and London reported that TikToks forays into online shopping had fallen short of the companys own expectations. Today we got some confirmation on just how disappointing that activity has been: TikTok is no longer expanding live ecommerce efforts in the U.S. and Europe after a lack of uptake the Financial Times reported.The decision comes just as other social networks such as Meta Platforms Snap Twitter YouTube and Pinterest rev up their e-commerce efforts including live shopping. These products should both incentivize creators to stay on the networks make up for slowing digital ad growth and provide advertisers with more tailored info on what users want. Its easy to see the appeal. Socially-driven shopping has been a hit in China. ByteDances sister short-form video app Douyin aims to double the volume of shopping on the platform to nearly 240 billion this year my colleagues reported.But even while TikTok has forced other social networks to hastily roll out copycat products and features it hasnt got this particular feature to work with its avid fans. The FT reports TikTok yanked the chord on its shoppingafter its U.K. effort didnt meet targets and influencers dropped out of the program. We previously reported TikToks daily transactions in the U.K. have mostly stayed below 1.2 million partly because the company has struggled to convince U.K.-based merchants to join the platform.TikToks decision is a warning for the newest crop of social e-commerce efforts particularly as theyre launching just as inflation and an economic slowdown reduce consumers spending power.

7566,SeekingMoreInfo,Is this a permanent role To change my track would also depend on thesalary and package. I am at present putting the programme together for the power generationplant at the Grange at present but it is not green as it is a diesel  gasplant and was somewhat surprised no green elements are employed like energyfrom waste a wind turbine or solar farm. I was tasked to look at potential workloads in Ireland and I am well awareof the requirements for increased generation required for the data centrespharma projects and distilleries. I know the River Shannon has numbers ofturbines on it and I expect this also could be further improved with moreefficient turbines and installations. This could also be further developedin the UK as a great deal of the mill streams still exist and it is puttingthem back into use instead of powering a mill but generating power. It would also be a point to also look at Elephant grass animal wastemethane and other agri fuels especially in Ireland. I also believe that there is a requirement that all warehouses shouldbecome solar farms and that car parks certainly at services should alsobecome farms allowing for the generation of power to feed electric cars. There are also future requirements in the cladding of buildings and themounting of turbines on buildings to also generate power with architecturalvisual blades and not just the standard propeller. There is a different vision that to have many small sources that feed thegrid instead of a dedicated number of large power stations feeding thepower supply. Please call me on 07702059469.

9977,SeekingMoreInfo,Below is what I had shared earlier with you when you had asked me similarquestions earlier. :Inbound etingWe offer tailor made engagements for : - SEO SMO ASO Content Backlinks - Email eting Lead Generation - LinkedIn Lead GenerationDigital Advertising :Below are a few of the engagements - Social Media eting - Search Engine eting - Apps store eting - Affiliate eting - Third Party Ad NetworksDevelopment :The final development cost depends on the scope and technology and costestimation requires at least 1 call to understand the scope. Also itinvolves an analysis of the existing architecture of the web.Now how are we different - Unlike many others in each of our marketing engagements we offer a team of experts that work dedicatedly and collectively for your brand and thereby create marketing and branding strategies. Each marketing team will have a strategist or a consultant that will run the point and overlook the execution - We do not have packages based on keywords. In fact we dont believe in limiting keywords. - We are 73 in headcount and thus do everything in-house. Dont forget to cross-check on LinkedIn - Our avg. client retention is 14 months and we are very picky when it comes to clients meaning we only finally work with clients where we feel we can add value. This point is extremely important to us as an agencyFinally. CostOur charges start from 20 USD per hour for mobile app development anddepending upon the technology- Swift Kotlin React Native Flutter etc.the price may go up to 25 USD per hour. The final cost as I mentionedwould depend on the scope and existing architecture.Our organic marketing engagements start from 800 USD per month and forDigital Advertising the minimum commission that we charge is 500 USD.I hope I was able to answer a lot of questions. I want to do better and Idont mind helping you set up a call with our team. We can offer yougeneral estimates and find out if there can be a fit. Would that makesense :Well see if you can find a suitable time here on our calendar:meetings.hubspot.com

I really appreciate GRS approaching me considering I am trying tochange my career towards the CleanTech sector in the West Midlands.Nice hook mail subject from Django Unchained by the way in thiscase it truly applies to me considering your GRS colleague Jann Del Corroalready contacted me on March 3rd for the same position at KEW Technology.Precisely Konstantina Stamouli whom I know from our PhD days at theUniversity of Birmingham left KEW Technology exactly in March after 1 yearand 3 months as Technical Development Manager. I always used to tell herthat her PhD topic was a continuation of my Master Thesis.After discussing with Jann Del Corro on the phone it was clear that I didnot have the desired seniorityexperimental experience in gasification orcatalytic synthesis. I am not going to waste your and my time but since Iam passionate about Waste to Energy I was finalist in 2019 for a positionas Technical Scientific Officer at the CEWEP in Brussels I activelyfollow the ESWET activities in LinkedIn and Twitter and since KEWTechnology are apparently looking to fill this position at least sinceearly March I would be very grateful if you could propose thepossibility of a different offer that adapted more to my profile. I havealways been interested in residual waste management and thermal engineeringduring my education. Things that I forgot to mention to Jann:- My Master Thesis pretty much like Konstantina Stamoulis PhD wasrelated to the pyrolysis of residual waste Low Density Polyethylenehowever from a design perspective. In fact the reactor I designed wasa fluidisedbed interestingly the same kind as the KEW Technology employs.- My PhD Thesis was related to the thermodynamic performance ofsupercritical coal-fired power plants via modelling Computational FluidDynamics. I also designed the rig for downscaled tests using supercriticalwater however due to lack of funding we could not purchase it.About gasification: I am familiar from a theoretical perspective viaeducation and during my intern days working on novel waste managementtechnologies. Some furnace designs share many similarities to pyrolysis andcombustion processes. It used to shock me back in 2010 that the synthesisgas requires most of the capital investment in order to be cleaned.About catalytic synthesis of hydrogen: I presume its about the water-gasshift reaction after the syngas is produced in order to increase thehydrogen yield but I have always focused more interest in the thermalprocess than the post processing of the synthesis gas.Gasification is indeed a fascinating technology that caught my eye morethan 10 years ago. It is very popular in Japan however in Westerncountries have never managed to reach proper commercial implementation.Hopefully now with the increase in popularity of Hydrogen for thetransition ...

1918,ConnectLater, Replies are not monitored so please do not email back. Thank you for your email which has been safely received. See estimate below on when to expect a fuller reply. How long will it take AVRillo to replyWhatever your views on the lifting of Covid restrictions many UK lawyers and lenders will continue to take up to a couple of weeks to reply with some search companies taking 12 weeks. This may get worse with expected staff absences as 4. 5 million are estimated to self-isolate with 100000 new Covid cases a day a rise in long Covid and the backlog of work from Covid and the recent stamp duty crisis. Can AVRillo reply faster than a couple of weeksOur award-winning service aims to review your email within 48 hours after which we will email you a time estimate for a fuller reply. If I chase you will you work fasterNo because our award-winning team are used to already working hard often in their own time evenings and weekends to help you move. Just remember their response times are tied by others in the process. Chasing will just slow you down by taking your lawyer away from your legal work. If I shout will you work fasterWe all know the answer is no but also know that as humans we get stressed and sometimes want the impossible. Sadly UK lawyers have seen an increase in cases where they have to stop acting because they are being bullied by unrealistic targets and demands being made of them. Rather than affecting both your and their mental wellbeing please understand you are not alone that moving is stressful and the closer we work together the better your outcome. Whats the  way of keeping in touch Can I get a faster update- Yes simply log into your live 247 portal by using your unique private password and username sent in our very first email to you. - Alternatively just wait for our highly rated automatic updates. You will get one each time we take a key step. - Keep phone calls and emails to a minimum to allow your lawyer to focus on your case. What can I do in an emergencyUse our call surgery to book a personal telephone appointment diary if you are about to exchange complete or dont understand something. We are unique as the only UK Conveyancing legal firm to give you direct access to our lawyers diaries twice a day every working day. Can I dis-instruct if my case is taking longer than your time estimateWhilst we cant do the impossible we do have one of the UKs  track records of hitting time estimates. However we know its frustrating when things are not as fast as you may want duringCovid. As such the regulators ask UK lawyers to explain to clients that they have the choice to dis-instruct and go to another firm. We dont want this but we wont get in your way if you decide to. Can you reassure me even moreOur own personal message is please try not to stress put safety first know you are not alone and try and put things into perspective if you can. Remember it could be worse and that moving is stressful in a Covid environment where for example Prime Ministers Questions in Parliament has predicted millions to self-isolate 100000 new Covid cases a day estimated by the Health secretary Sajid Javid the chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty warning a surge and further waves of coronavirus and the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges warning unprecedented pressure over the coming months.

7003,AgreedToMeet, First of all Hearty Birthday Greetings to you We are connected through the LinkedIn business network where I learnt aboutyour work. I found it very interesting since we have been into a businessthat supports research analysts in the laboratory. Our company has developeda software for analytical laboratories that manages research data processesit to generate useful analytics and manages complete workflows in thelaboratory from sample inception to the disposal. If you can spend some time to know more about this product EnsoLIMS we canarrange an online presentation for you and your team. Recently this softwarehas been adopted by the Coffee Board of India a central governmentinstitute in India. Similarly its running successfully at NATA certifiedfood lab in Australia. We are eager to know your thoughts on our offeringsand request you for a quick online meeting. Apart from this we also have a dedicated pool of software engineers that weprovide to our clients for fulfillment of specific technology skills ontheir projects on short-term basis. This works wonderfully for up-skillingor for increasing the resources midway. Gives benefit of cost and timeoptimization. Feel free to let me know if you have any questions about EnsoLIMS.

6942,ConnectLater,Well to be honest these dont help. SOC2 certificate of your data centers FIPS140-2 certified and validated cipher suites HIPAA compliance are the basic requirements. These are all US specific regulations and on top of that no US PHI data can be moved outside of the USA. To stir it further USA has a terrible network infrastructure. We need at least 3 main data centers and about 20 edge endpoints in order to reach to a meaningful response time after all we are doing soft-realtime EEG recordings. This requires hefty infrastructure dedicated barebone network traffic shaping reverse HTTP Proxying at the edge endpoints to isolate DDoS attacks and so on and so fort. We opted out from using Google and declined using a dedicated offer from IBM and not found Azure a good match either. Said that we are a very picky customer with a hefty expectations not only on the network but also on computing services managed databases multiple storage classes for long time storage rolling updates etc. I am afraid Artera is not in that league as of yet.

2694,ConnectLater,Thank you very much for your response to my inquiry in India-mart for areliable and verified supplier for the same as your product. I have a goodfriend who requested me to make this inquiry in India-martsense i havelittle idea in the India Market. Sir my friend told me that she have gone through your catalog  productdetails but I regret to inform you that she have cancelled to buy thisproduct from India as her customer has turn down the offer to import thisproduct from India due to customer terms and conditions etc. and she hasplaced the order of the product from her source in Taiwan as it will bemore faster and cheap due to the urgency to maintain the contracts. I shallinform you in future whenever she has such demand again so bear with us. MEANWHILE  I HAVE ANOTHER URGENT SUPPLYING DEAL TO SHAREDISCUSS WITH YOUONLY  IF YOU WILL BE INTERESTED TO DO THE BUSINESS WITH ME AND WILLING TOACCEPT MY TERMS AND CONDITION IN THIS NEW BUSINESS  PROPOSAL AS I WILL LIKEUS TO ENTER INTO WRITING AGREEMENT TO BUILD MORE TRUST AS THIS WILL BE ALONG TIME BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND OUR COMPANY TO SOURCE ANDSUPPLY OUR COMPANY ANY VETERINARYHUMAN  RAW MATERIAL OUR COMPANY MAY NEEDFROM INDIA FOR PRODUCTIONS NOW AND IN FUTURE. Sir the business is to supply veterinaryPharmaceutical raw materials toour company upon their arrival in Indiain a large quantity on a monthlybasis. I have been supplying these veterinary Pharmaceutical raw materialsto our company with the assistance of an India business man  who based inDubai U. A. E but he use to visit India any time our company issue himpurchase order the business was going on smoothly between my-self andMr. Vivek E. Sharma but unfortunately am trying to reach him on his mobilenumbers for 2 month now but his Dubai India number was switch off due tohis greedy over our last supply as he seat on all my commission. Therefore  I need a reliable trustworthy business man whom I can trustthat understand India local language to help me and contact the IndiaCompany to know if they have enough of this chemicals in stock as ourcompany is ready to visit India for the business as soon as possible due tothe urgency these chemicals is not a bane product in India or here in UKas it fail into 100 herbal extract . Note that: this supply does not require any Import or export license fromyou because our company treated this business as a domestic transaction andsent their delegate to India for inspection payment. Your role is just to stand as a middle man between our company delegate andthe India companysupplier. You will buy the chemical from the Indiacompany which I will link you with and you will supply our company delegatewithout allowing them to meet or have each others contact due to the pricegap for our benefit and for future transactions. I assured you that thisbusiness will not disturb your present workjob. I will use my position in the company and influence our director procurement department that you are the business partner to Mr. Vivek E. Sharma or distributor of the chemical company in India to enable ourcompany director to issue you purchase order in your favor and releaseadvance payment to you for bulk order after testing the sample. I will also give you the contact of the India company where Mr. Vivek E. Sharma bought the exact specification in the past so that you will buy thechemicals from them and supply to our company delegate upon his arrival inIndia then we will share the profit  50-50 after the supplybusiness. I will influence our director  procurement department to pay you at least60 advance payment to source the total order value upon sample testing OKand the balance 40 before handing the chemicals over to our companydelegate in New Delhi India. I personally came up with this idea toprotect my interest in the business. I will give you every necessary information you may need to make thebusiness successful as our company will send their delegate to Indiaimmediately for inspections and payment . If you are interested and willing to do the business with me then get backto me for more details. Please see attached here the scanned copy of our last purchase order issuedin the name of Mr. Vivek E. Sharma for your reference. Your urgent reply is highly needed and you can contact me with the belowWhatsApp number.
