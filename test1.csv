Cloud migrations have soared over the last year to ensure businesscontinuity and accelerate transformations.Although the public cloud is a central pillar of everyonexe2u20acu2122s digitaltransformation strategy attempting to migrate all applications andinfrastructure to a single cloud provider risks cost overruns and outrightmigration failure.72 of companies who have migrated to the public cloud report that they haverepatriated at least onemajor application on-premise.What your customers need instead is to deploy applications into the bestlocation possible and integrate them across on-premises your private cloudand the public cloud. The market for such hybrid cloud services is growingrapidly and is expected to reach USD 145 billion.The big question is as a data center managed services and private cloudleader are you able to provide this hybrid cloud capabilityIt is extraordinarily difficult to integrate multiple clouds or public cloudswith on-premise and private cloud locations. This requires complexarchitectural components including service discovery monitoring DNSarchitecture network configuration and a variety of other integrations.European MSPs are effortlessly deploying hybrid cloud architectures andupgrading their private cloud capabilities with cutting-edge Kubernetes andcontainer deployments by using ProtoCloud.The platform takes a radically different approach to deploying applications andinfrastructure together whether on-premise into a private cloud the publiccloud or edge locations. It simplifies deployments with pre-integrated toolingand more.ProtoCloud helps companies accelerate migrating and modernizing applicationswithout imposing an all-or-nothing migration or a complete redevelopment. Allthis in a single well-architected platform.If this piques your interest can we ask for 10 minutes in your diary to helpyou offer these capabilities to your customersWarm
